# Taxi_Fare_Prediction_Model
This project implement's a predictive model to estimate taxi fare amounts before the ride commences. Leveraging thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and a meticulously constructed multiple regression model, we aim to provide accurate and transparent fare predictions. This repository contains the code, datasets, related to our analysis.

## Project Overview
The project endeavors to revolutionize the taxi industry by implementing a predictive model to estimate taxi fare amounts prior to the ride. Thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the dataset revealed significant insights, particularly a robust linear relationship between fare_amount, mean_duration, and mean_distance. Leveraging these insights, a multiple regression model was meticulously constructed, showcasing exceptional performance metrics. The model boasts an impressive R^2 value of 0.86, signifying a high degree of explained variance. Additionally, it demonstrates a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 2.13, Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 14.32, and a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 3.78, affirming its accuracy and reliability for predicting taxi fares.

## Business Understanding
The project addresses a critical challenge in the taxi industry: predicting fare amounts before the commencement of a ride. This capability holds significant implications for both passengers and taxi service providers. Transparent fare predictions empower passengers with better budgeting and planning, enhancing their overall experience. For taxi companies and drivers, accurate fare predictions lead to improved customer satisfaction and optimal resource utilization.

## Data Understanding
The analysis utilized a comprehensive dataset, "2017_Yellow_Taxi_Trip_Data.csv," merged with "nyc_preds_means.csv." The primary dataset, "2017_Yellow_Taxi_Trip_Data.csv," was sourced from the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission and published under the NYC Open Data program. Further details about the dataset can be found in the NYC taxi dataset documentation.
